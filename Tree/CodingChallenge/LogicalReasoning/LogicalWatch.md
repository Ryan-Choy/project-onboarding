A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday. It was noticed to be 7 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday. 
When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed. 

a) 7 a.m. Saturday b) 7 a.m. on Friday 

c) 10a.m. on Sunday d) 11 a.m. on Friday

The answer is a) 7 a.m. Saturday 

Explaination
The number of hours from 8 p.m. on Thursday to 8 a.m. on Monday is 84 hours. Over the course of those 84 hours, the watch lost 12 minutes (65-53) but the watch just has to lose 5 minutes to be correct for one of the four answers since they are all on the exact hour. Therefore, the exact number of hours is a fraction of 84 and so the formula used is:

(5/12) x 84, which equals to 35 and 35 hours later from 8 p.m. Thursday is 7 a.m. Saturday.
